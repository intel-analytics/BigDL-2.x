# Object Detection

[Object detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection)
deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos.

This repository contains two popular object detection pipelines:
* [SSD](ssd)
* [Faster-RCNN](fasterrcnn)

If you want to get quick start, you can find Jupyter demos [here](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/apps/ssd)

You can also find blogs on application of this library:
