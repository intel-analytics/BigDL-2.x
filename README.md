# <font size="6"> What is Analytics Zoo? </font>

Analytics Zoo provides a unified data analytics and AI platform that seamlessly unites TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Spark, Flink and Ray programs into an integrated pipeline, which can transparently scale from a laptop to large clusters to process production big data.

- **Integrated Analytics and AI Pipelines** for easily prototyping and deploying end-to-end AI applications. 
  - Write [TensorFlow](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#ProgrammingGuide/TFPark/tensorflow/) or [PyTorch](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#ProgrammingGuide/pytorch/) inline with Spark code for distributed training and inference.
  - Native deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch/BigDL) support in [Spark ML](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#ProgrammingGuide/nnframes) Pipelines.
  - Directly run Ray programs on big data cluster through [RayOnSpark](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#ProgrammingGuide/rayonspark/). 
  - Plain Java/Python APIs for (TensorFlow/PyTorch/BigDL/OpenVINO) [Model Inference](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#ProgrammingGuide/inference). 

- High-Level **ML Workflow** that automates the process of building large-scale machine learning applications.
  - Automatically distributed [Cluster Serving](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#ClusterServingGuide/ProgrammingGuide) (for TensorFlow/PyTorch/Caffe/BigDL/OpenVINO models) with a simple pub/sub API. 
  - Scalable [AutoML](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/blob/automl/pyzoo/zoo/automl/README.md) for time series prediction (that automatically generates features, selects models and tunes hyperparameters).

- **Built-in Algorithms and Models** for [Recommendation](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#APIGuide/Models/recommendation/), [Time Series](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#APIGuide/Models/anomaly-detection/), [Computer Vision](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#APIGuide/Models/object-detection/) and [NLP](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#APIGuide/Models/seq2seq/) applications.

# <font size="6">Why use Analytics Zoo? </font>

You may want to develop your AI solutions using Analytics Zoo if:
- You want to easily prototype the entire end-to-end pipeline that applies AI models (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, BigDL, OpenVINO, etc.) to production big data.
- You want to transparently scale your AI applications from a laptop to large clusters with "zero" code changes.
- You want to deploy your AI pipelines to existing YARN or K8S clusters *WITHOUT* any modifications to the clusters.
- You want to automate the process of applying machine learning (such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model selection and distributed inference).
