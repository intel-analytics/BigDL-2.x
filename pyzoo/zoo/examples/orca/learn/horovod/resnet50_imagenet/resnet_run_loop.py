  This module contains ResNet code which does not directly build layers. This
includes dataset management, hyperparameter and optimizer code, and argument
parsing. Code for defining the ResNet layers can be found in resnet_model.py.

    dataset: A Dataset representing raw records
    is_training: A boolean denoting whether the input is for training.
    batch_size: The number of samples per batch.
    shuffle_buffer: The buffer size to use when shuffling records. A larger
      value results in better randomness, but smaller values reduce startup
      time and use less memory.
    parse_record_fn: A function that takes a raw record and returns the
      corresponding (image, label) pair.
    num_epochs: The number of epochs to repeat the dataset.
    num_gpus: The number of gpus used for training.
    examples_per_epoch: The number of examples in an epoch.
