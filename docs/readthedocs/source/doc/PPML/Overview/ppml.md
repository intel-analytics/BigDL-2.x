# PPML (Privacy Preserving Machine Learning)

Analtyics-Zoo PPML is an end to end framework for building privacy presrving maching leanrnig applications on top of large scale dataset. 

## PPML for Big Data AI

Among most commonly used PPML technologies, i.e., HE (Homomorphic Encryption), MPC (Multi-Party Computation) or SMC (Secure Multi-Party Computation), DP (Differential Privacy) and TEE (Trusted Execution Environment), we choose Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions), a widely used TEE technology, performs well on all measures, i.e., security, performance and utility.

as our main to build PPML related application.

Based on Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions) and LibOS projects, this framework empowers data scientists and big data developers to build PPML applications on top of large scale dataset without impacting existing applications.


Key features:

- Protecting Data and model confidentiality
- Trusted Big Data AI Platform based on Intel SGX



Note: Intel SGX requires hardware support, please [check if your CPU has this feature](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000028173/processors/intel-core-processors.html).


Scenario:

- Protecting sensitive input/output data (computation, training and inference) in data application, e.g.,data analysis or machine learning on healthcare dataset.
- Protecting propretary model, e.g., model trained on self-owned data or sensitive data.
