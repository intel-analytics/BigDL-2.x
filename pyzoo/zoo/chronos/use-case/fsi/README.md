## Stock prediction  use case in Chronos

---
We demonstrate how to use Chronos to predict stock prices based on historical time series data.

In the reference use case, we use the publicly available daily stock price of S&P500 stocks during 2013-2018 ([data source](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/sandp500/))

This use case example contains a notebook:

- **stock_prediction.ipynb** demonstrates how to leverage Chronos's built-in models ie. LSTM, to do time series forecasting. Reference: https://github.com/jwkanggist/tf-keras-stock-pred


### Install

You can refer to Chronos installation document [here](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#Chronos/tutorials/LSTMForecasterAndMTNetForecaster/#step-0-prepare-environment).

### Prepare dataset
- The notebook has a cell for downloading and preprocess the dataset.
