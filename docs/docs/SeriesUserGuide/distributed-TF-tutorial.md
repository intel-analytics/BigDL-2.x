This guide trains a neural network model to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts. It's okay if you don't understand all the details, this is a fast-paced overview of a complete TensorFlow program with the details explained as we go.

This guide uses [tf.keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras), a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow.

## Load and Preprocess the data

### _Import the Fashion MNIST dataset_

This guide uses the [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28 by 28 pixels), as seen here:

Fashion MNIST is intended as a drop-in replacement for the classic [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset—often used as the "Hello, World" of machine learning programs for computer vision. The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits (0, 1, 2, etc) in an identical format to the articles of clothing we'll use here.

This guide uses Fashion MNIST for variety, and because it's a slightly more challenging problem than regular MNIST. Both datasets are relatively small and are used to verify that an algorithm works as expected. They're good starting points to test and debug code.

We will use 60,000 images to train the network and 10,000 images to evaluate how accurately the network learned to classify images. You can access the Fashion MNIST directly from TensorFlow, just import and load the data:

```python
from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_literals

# TensorFlow and tf.keras
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Helper libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# You MUST use tensorflow 1.10.0
!pip install tensorflow==1.10.0
# print(tf.__version__)
```

```python
fashion_mnist = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist

(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = fashion_mnist.load_data()
```

Loading the dataset returns four NumPy arrays:

- The `train_images` and `train_labels` arrays are the *training set*—the data the model uses to learn.
- The model is tested against the *test set*, the `test_images`, and `test_labels` arrays.

The images are 28x28 NumPy arrays, with pixel values ranging between 0 and 255. The *labels* are an array of integers, ranging from 0 to 9. These correspond to the *class* of clothing the image represents:

| Label | Class       |
| :---- | ----------- |
| 0     | T-shirt/top |
| 1     | Trouser     |
| 2     | Pullover    |
| 3     | Dress       |
| 4     | Coat        |
| 5     | Sandal      |
| 6     | Shirt       |
| 7     | Sneaker     |
| 8     | Bag         |
| 9     | Ankle boot  |

Each image is mapped to a single label. Since the *class names* are not included with the dataset, store them here to use later when plotting the images:

```python
class_names = ['T-shirt/top', 'Trouser', 'Pullover', 'Dress', 'Coat',
               'Sandal', 'Shirt', 'Sneaker', 'Bag', 'Ankle boot']
```

### _Explore the data_

Let's explore the format of the dataset before training the model. The following shows there are 60,000 images in the training set, with each image represented as 28 x 28 pixels:

```python
train_images.shape
```

Out:

```
(60000, 28, 28)
```

Likewise, there are 60,000 labels in the training set, and each label is an integer between 0 and 9:

```python
print(len(train_labels))
print(train_labels)
```

Out:

```
60000
[9 0 0 ... 3 0 5]
```

There are 10,000 images in the test set. Again, each image is represented as 28 x 28 pixels:

```python
test_images.shape
```

Out:

```
(10000, 28, 28)
```

### _Preprocess the data_

The data must be preprocessed before training the network. If you inspect the first image in the training set, you will see that the pixel values fall in the range of 0 to 255:

```python
plt.figure()
plt.imshow(train_images[0])
plt.colorbar()
plt.grid(False)
plt.show()
```

[![png](https://github.com/Le-Zheng/zoo-tutorials/raw/test_origin/workspace/basic_classification_files/basic_classification_24_0.png)](https://github.com/Le-Zheng/zoo-tutorials/blob/test_origin/workspace/basic_classification_files/basic_classification_24_0.png)

We scale these values to a range of 0 to 1 before feeding to the neural network model. For this, we divide the values by 255. It's important that the *training set* and the *testing set* are preprocessed in the same way:

```python
train_images = train_images / 255.0

test_images = test_images / 255.0
```

Display the first 25 images from the *training set* and display the class name below each image. Verify that the data is in the correct format and we're ready to build and train the network.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
for i in range(25):
    plt.subplot(5,5,i+1)
    plt.xticks([])
    plt.yticks([])
    plt.grid(False)
    plt.imshow(train_images[i], cmap=plt.cm.binary)
    plt.xlabel(class_names[train_labels[i]])
plt.show()
```

[![png](https://github.com/Le-Zheng/zoo-tutorials/raw/test_origin/workspace/basic_classification_files/basic_classification_28_0.png)](https://github.com/Le-Zheng/zoo-tutorials/blob/test_origin/workspace/basic_classification_files/basic_classification_28_0.png)

## 2. Build the model

Building the neural network requires configuring the layers of the model, then compiling the model.

### _Setup the layers_

The basic building block of a neural network is the *layer*. Layers extract representations from the data fed into them. And, hopefully, these representations are more meaningful for the problem at hand.

Most of deep learning consists of chaining together simple layers. Most layers, like `tf.keras.layers.Dense`, have parameters that are learned during training.

```python
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation=tf.nn.relu),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=tf.nn.softmax)
])
```

The first layer in this network, `tf.keras.layers.Flatten`, transforms the format of the images from a 2d-array (of 28 by 28 pixels), to a 1d-array of 28 * 28 = 784 pixels. Think of this layer as unstacking rows of pixels in the image and lining them up. This layer has no parameters to learn; it only reformats the data.

After the pixels are flattened, the network consists of a sequence of two `tf.keras.layers.Dense` layers. These are densely-connected, or fully-connected, neural layers. The first `Dense` layer has 128 nodes (or neurons). The second (and last) layer is a 10-node *softmax* layer—this returns an array of 10 probability scores that sum to 1. Each node contains a score that indicates the probability that the current image belongs to one of the 10 classes.

### _Compile the model_

Before the model is ready for training, it needs a few more settings. These are added during the model's *compile* step:

- *Loss function* —This measures how accurate the model is during training. We want to minimize this function to "steer" the model in the right direction.
- *Optimizer* —This is how the model is updated based on the data it sees and its loss function.
- *Metrics* —Used to monitor the training and testing steps. The following example uses *accuracy*, the fraction of the images that are correctly classified.

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Now to support distributed training, evaluation and prediction, we need to wrap our keras model with Analytics Zoo api.

Prepare environment:

```python
# set Spark diver memory
%env SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY=4g

# Install jdk8
!apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk-headless -qq > /dev/null

# Set jdk environment path which enables you to run Pyspark in your Colab environment.
import os
os.environ["JAVA_HOME"] = "/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64"

# Set up Analytics Zoo
!pip install analytics-zoo==0.6.0.dev6
```

```python
from zoo.tfpark import KerasModel, TFDataset
from zoo import init_nncontext
# set up enviroment
_ = init_nncontext()
# wrap model as tfpark model for distributted training, evaluation and prediction
model = KerasModel(model)
```

Out:

```
Prepending /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/bigdl/share/conf/spark-bigdl.conf to sys.path
Adding /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/zoo/share/lib/analytics-zoo-bigdl_0.8.0-spark_2.4.3-0.6.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar to BIGDL_JARS
Prepending /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/zoo/share/conf/spark-analytics-zoo.conf to sys.path
```

## 3. Train the model

Training the neural network model requires the following steps:

1. Feed the training data to the model—in this example, the `train_images` and `train_labels` arrays.
2. The model learns to associate images and labels.
3. We ask the model to make predictions about a test set—in this example, the `test_images` array. We verify that the predictions match the labels from the `test_labels` array.

To start training, call the `model.fit` method—the model is "fit" to the training data:

```python
dataset = TFDataset.from_ndarrays((train_images, train_labels),
                                 batch_size=160,
                                 val_tensors=(test_images, test_labels))
model.fit(dataset, epochs=5)
```

Out:

```
creating: createAdam
creating: createZooKerasSparseCategoricalCrossEntropy
creating: createLoss
creating: createZooKerasSparseCategoricalAccuracy

```

As the model trains, the loss and accuracy metrics are displayed. This model reaches an accuracy of about 0.86 (or 86%) on the training data.

## 4. Evaluate accuracy

Next, compare how the model performs on the test dataset:

```python
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, batch_per_thread=280, distributed=True)

print('Test accuracy:', test_acc)
```

Out:

```
INFO:tensorflow:Froze 4 variables.
INFO:tensorflow:Converted 4 variables to const ops.
creating: createTFNet
creating: createZooKerasSparseCategoricalCrossEntropy
creating: createLoss
creating: createZooKerasSparseCategoricalAccuracy
Test accuracy: 0.8608999848365784
```

## 5. Make predictions

With the model trained, we can use it to make predictions about some images.

```python
predictions = model.predict(test_images, batch_per_thread=280, distributed=True)
```

Out:

```
INFO:tensorflow:Froze 4 variables.
INFO:tensorflow:Converted 4 variables to const ops.
creating: createTFNet
```

Here, the model has predicted the label for each image in the testing set. Let's take a look at the first prediction:

```python
predictions[0]
```

Out:

```
array([5.0464441e-06, 2.8245449e-08, 3.7241246e-06, 1.3102062e-06,
       3.4668458e-06, 7.1749002e-02, 3.8643364e-05, 1.4251211e-02,
       9.8233577e-05, 9.1384935e-01], dtype=float32)
```

A prediction is an array of 10 numbers. These describe the "confidence" of the model that the image corresponds to each of the 10 different articles of clothing. We can see which label has the highest confidence value:

```python
np.argmax(predictions[0])
```

Out:

```
9
```

So the model is most confident that this image is an ankle boot, or `class_names[9]`. And we can check the test label to see this is correct:

```python
test_labels[0]
```

Out:

```
9
```

We can graph this to look at the full set of 10 class predictions

```python
def plot_image(i, predictions_array, true_label, img):
  predictions_array, true_label, img = predictions_array[i], true_label[i], img[i]
  plt.grid(False)
  plt.xticks([])
  plt.yticks([])

  plt.imshow(img, cmap=plt.cm.binary)

  predicted_label = np.argmax(predictions_array)
  if predicted_label == true_label:
    color = 'blue'
  else:
    color = 'red'

  plt.xlabel("{} {:2.0f}% ({})".format(class_names[predicted_label],
                                100*np.max(predictions_array),
                                class_names[true_label]),
                                color=color)

def plot_value_array(i, predictions_array, true_label):
  predictions_array, true_label = predictions_array[i], true_label[i]
  plt.grid(False)
  plt.xticks([])
  plt.yticks([])
  thisplot = plt.bar(range(10), predictions_array, color="#777777")
  plt.ylim([0, 1])
  predicted_label = np.argmax(predictions_array)

  thisplot[predicted_label].set_color('red')
  thisplot[true_label].set_color('blue')
```

Let's look at the 0th image, predictions, and prediction array.

```python
i = 0
plt.figure(figsize=(6,3))
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plot_image(i, predictions, test_labels, test_images)
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plot_value_array(i, predictions,  test_labels)
plt.show()
```

Let's look at the 12th image, predictions, and prediction array.

```python
i = 12
plt.figure(figsize=(6,3))
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plot_image(i, predictions, test_labels, test_images)
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plot_value_array(i, predictions,  test_labels)
plt.show()
```

[![png](https://github.com/Le-Zheng/zoo-tutorials/raw/test_origin/workspace/basic_classification_files/basic_classification_53_0.png)](https://github.com/Le-Zheng/zoo-tutorials/blob/test_origin/workspace/basic_classification_files/basic_classification_53_0.png)

Let's plot several images with their predictions. Correct prediction labels are blue and incorrect prediction labels are red. The number gives the percent (out of 100) for the predicted label. Note that it can be wrong even when very confident.

```python
# Plot the first X test images, their predicted label, and the true label
# Color correct predictions in blue, incorrect predictions in red
num_rows = 5
num_cols = 3
num_images = num_rows*num_cols
plt.figure(figsize=(2*2*num_cols, 2*num_rows))
for i in range(num_images):
  plt.subplot(num_rows, 2*num_cols, 2*i+1)
  plot_image(i, predictions, test_labels, test_images)
  plt.subplot(num_rows, 2*num_cols, 2*i+2)
  plot_value_array(i, predictions, test_labels)
plt.show()
```

[![png](https://github.com/Le-Zheng/zoo-tutorials/raw/test_origin/workspace/basic_classification_files/basic_classification_55_0.png)](https://github.com/Le-Zheng/zoo-tutorials/blob/test_origin/workspace/basic_classification_files/basic_classification_55_0.png)

Finally, use the trained model to make a prediction about a single image.

```python
# Grab an image from the test dataset
img = test_images[0]
print(img.shape)
```

Out:

```
(28, 28)
```

`tf.keras` models are optimized to make predictions on a *batch*, or collection, of examples at once. So even though we're using a single image, we need to add it to a list:

```python
# Add the image to a batch where it's the only member.
img = (np.expand_dims(img,0))
print(img.shape)
```

Out:

```
(1, 28, 28)
```

Now predict the image:

```python
predictions_single = model.predict(img)
print(predictions_single)

plot_value_array(0, predictions_single, test_labels)
plt.xticks(range(10), class_names, rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

Out:

```
[[5.0464437e-06 2.8245445e-08 3.7241239e-06 1.3102086e-06 3.4668453e-06
  7.1749061e-02 3.8643360e-05 1.4251209e-02 9.8233468e-05 9.1384923e-01]]
```

[![png](https://github.com/Le-Zheng/zoo-tutorials/raw/test_origin/workspace/basic_classification_files/basic_classification_62_0.png)](https://github.com/Le-Zheng/zoo-tutorials/blob/test_origin/workspace/basic_classification_files/basic_classification_62_0.png)

`model.predict` returns a list of lists, one for each image in the batch of data. Grab the predictions for our (only) image in the batch:

```python
prediction_result = np.argmax(predictions_single[0])
print(prediction_result)
```

Out:

```
9
```

And, as before, the model predicts a label of 9.
