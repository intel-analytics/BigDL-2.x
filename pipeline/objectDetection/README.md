# Object Detection

[Object detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection)
deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos.

This repository contains two popular object detection pipelines:
* [SSD](ssd)
* [Faster-RCNN](fasterrcnn)

## Build
```
git clone https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo.git
cd analytics-zoo/pipeline/objectDetection
./build.sh
```

## Pre-trained model
A series of pre-trained model can be found
[here](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/models).

## Demo
If you want to get quick start, you can find Jupyter demos [here](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/apps/ssd).
