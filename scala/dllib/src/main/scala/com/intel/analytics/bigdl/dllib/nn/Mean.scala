/**
 * It is a simple layer which applies a mean operation over the given dimension.
 * When nInputDims is provided, the input will be considered as batches.
 * Then the mean operation will be applied in (dimension + 1).
 *
 * The input to this layer is expected to be a tensor, or a batch of tensors;
 * when using mini-batch, a batch of sample tensors will be passed to the layer and
 * the user need to specify the number of dimensions of each sample tensor in the
 * batch using `nInputDims`.
 *
 * @param dimension the dimension to be applied mean operation
 * @param nInputDims specify the number of dimensions that this module will receive
 *                   If it is more than the dimension of input tensors, the first dimension
 *                   would be considered as batch size
 * @param squeeze default is true, which will squeeze the sum dimension; set it to false to keep
 *                the sum dimension
