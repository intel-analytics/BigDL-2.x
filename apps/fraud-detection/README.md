# Fraud Detection
As a highly simplified demo, this notebook uses the public data set to build a fraud detection example on Apache Spark.

The notebook is developed using Scala with Analytics Zoo for Spark 2.1 and BigDL.


Download the dataset ([Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data))(E.g. download to /tmp/datasets/creditcard.csv)

How to run the notebook:

1. Refer to [Apache Toree](https://github.com/apache/incubator-toree/blob/master/README.md) for
how to use scala in Jupyter notebook.

An outline is:
```bash
pip install https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/toree/0.2.0/snapshots/dev1/toree-pip/toree-0.2.0.dev1.tar.gz
```
Run `export SPARK_HOME=the root directory of Spark`.

To set up scala kernal, use
```
jupyter toree install --spark_opts='--master=local[*]' --user --spark_home=$SPARK_HOME
```

2. Build Analytics Zoo jar file under Spark 2.x.
* Download Analytics Zoo and build it.
* Run `export ANALYTICS_ZOO_HOME=the dist directory under the Analytics Zoo project`.

3. To support the training for imbalanced data set in fraud detection, some Transformers and algorithms are developed in 
https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/legacy/pipeline/fraudDetection. We provided a pre-built jar file in this folder. Feel free to go to the source folder and run "mvn clean package" to build from source.


4. Run the `$ANALYTICS_ZOO_HOME/apps/fraud-detection/run.sh` to start the jupyter notebook. Change parameter settings as you need, ie `MASTER = local[physcial_core_number]`.
Recommended driver memory and executor memory is 10g.
