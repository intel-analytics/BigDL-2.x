class MXNetTrainer(object):
    """
    MXNetTrainer provides an automatic setup for synchronous distributed MXNet training.

    :param config: A dictionary for training configurations. Keys must include the following:
    batch_size, optimizer, optimizer_params, log_interval.
    optimizer should be an MXNet optimizer or its string representation.
    optimizer_params should be a dict in companion with the optimizer. It can contain learning_rate
    and other optimization configurations.
    log_interval should be an integer, specifying the interval for logging throughput and metrics
    if any during the training process.
    You can call create_trainer_config to create the config easily.
    You can specify "seed" in config to set random seed.
    You can specify "init" in seed to set model initializer.

    :param data_creator: A function that takes config and kv as arguments and returns an MXNet
    DataIter/DataLoader for training or a tuple of training and validation datasets.
    You can specify data related configurations for this function in the config argument above.
    kv is an instance of MXNet distributed key-value store. kv.num_workers and kv.rank
    can be used in this function to split data for different workers if necessary.

    :param model_creator: A function that takes config as argument and returns an MXNet model.
    The model can be defined either using MXNet symbolic API or imperative(gluon) API.

    :param loss_creator: A function that takes config as argument and returns an MXNet loss.
    This is not needed for symbolic API where loss is already defined as model output.

    :param metrics_creator: A function that takes config as argument and returns one or a list of
    MXNet metrics or corresponding string representations of metrics, for example, 'accuracy'.
    This is not needed if you don't have validation data throughout the training.

    :param num_workers: The number of workers for distributed training. Default is 1.
    :param num_servers: The number of servers for distributed training. Default is None and in this
    case it would be equal to the number of workers.
    :param runner_cores: The number of CPU cores allocated for each MXNet worker and server.
    Default is None. You may need to specify this for better performance.
