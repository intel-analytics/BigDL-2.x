# Setup Analytics Zoo On ICP4D

Analytics Zoo is an open source project which is licensed under [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/blob/master/LICENSE).

## **Prerequisites**
To deploy Analytics Zoo on ICP4D, the following prerequisites must be met:
1. Having an ICP4D account with IBM and a working installation of ICP4D on your cluster.
2. Having sufficient privileges to that cluster so that you can run kubectl/helm and log in to the ICP4D internal docker registry. How to do this is described in the [ICP4D documentation](https://docs-icpdata.mybluemix.net/docs/content/SSQNUZ_current/com.ibm.icpdata.doc/zen/overview/overview.html).

## **Work Flow**
Deploying Analytics Zoo on ICP4D uses the following workflow:

1. After logging into your cluster with your ICP4D credentials in your web browser, , find Analytics Zoo in the Add-ons section.
2. Open the menu in the corner of the Analytics Zoo tile and click Get Started.
3. You are then forwarded in your browser to this page (the one you are reading) on Analytics Zoo's doc site.

## **Installation**
Follow the steps to have the Analytics Zoo up and running on your cluster.

1.  SSH to the ICP4D cluster
```
ssh root@<ICP4D-cluster-master-node>
```
2. Edit your /etc/hosts file on your system (Linux/MacOS) or equivalent (Windows) to add a DNS entry for the ICP4D cluster you'll be connecting to (this is needed for the Docker steps below):
```bash
<IP to your ICP4D cluster provided by your system administrator> mycluster.icp
Example:
169.55.96.201 mycluster.icp
```
3. Ensure that you have the correct Kubectl, Helm, Cloudctl, and Docker versions that you have downloaded directly from the ICP4D environment.
```
If you haven't done so already, get the kubectl/helm/cloudctl binaries corresponding to your platform. Here are the versions used to validate these instructions:
Kubectl v1.11.1
Helm v2.9.1
Cloudctl v3.1.0-715+e4d4ee1d28cc2a588dabc0f54067841ad6c36ec9
Docker v18.06.1-ce
Those binaries can be downloaded from the ICP4D cluster itself at:
<HTTPS address of your ICP4D cluster provided by your system administrator>:8443/api/cli/
Please refer to the ICP4D command line documentation for more information on those.
```
4. Edit your Docker configuration to allow the push to insecure registries:

* If using Linux, edit /etc/docker/daemon.json and add :
```bash
{ "insecure-registries" : ["mycluster.icp:8500"]} 
```

* If using Mac/Windows (with use of Docker Desktop):

    a. Find the Docker icon in the system status bar and click on the Preferences menu entry.

    b. Go to the Daemon tab and find the Insecure Registries entry list.
    
    c. Create an entry for mycluster.icp:8500
    
    d. Restart the Docker Daemon.
* NOTE: It isn't recommended to edit Docker config files manually when on Mac/Windows. It is recommended to use Docker Desktop.

5. From your terminal, pull the Analytics Zoo image form Dockerhub with:
```bash
docker pull intelanalytics/analytics-zoo:0.5.1-2.2.1-0.8.0-py3
```
6. Push the docker image from your node to the docker registry using the following commands:

    a. Tag the image
    ```bash
    docker tag intelanalytics/analytics-zoo:0.5.1-2.2.1-0.8.0-py3 mycluster.icp:8500/zen/intelanalytics/analytics-zoo:0.5.1-2.2.1-0.8.0-py3
    ```
    b. Push the image to the private image registry.
    ```bash
    docker push mycluster.icp:8500/zen/intelanalytics/analytics-zoo:0.5.1-2.2.1-0.8.0-py3
    ```

7. Clone the github repository intel-analytics/analytics-zoo to receive a copy of the helmchart. Browse to the helm charts directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo.git
cd analytics-zoo/helmchart/analytics-zoo
```
8. Install the helmchart archive and connect to a spark master:
```bash
helm install . --name analytics-zoo --namespace zen --set SparkMaster=local[*] --tls
```
Run the following kubectl commands to verify the deployment.
```bash
kubectl get svc -n zen|grep analytics-zoo
kubectl get pod -n zen|grep analytics-zoo
kubectl describe pod <the_pod_it_made> -n zen
```
```bash
kubectl describe svc analytics-zoo-analytics-zoo -n zen
```
From the output of above command, you can find the NodePort of the service. You can use this port to access analytics zoo service in web browser. 

## Using Analytics Zoo
After you install the Analytics Zoo Add-on, you can open web browser, go to http://<MASTER_1_IP>:<port_number> to access the Jupyter notebook with analytics zoo. The port number is the NodePort number. You can find many use cases/examples under current directory. Click one example and open one notebook to run.

## Uninstalling the chart
To uninstall/delete the analytics-zoo deployment:
```bash
helm delete --purge analytics-zoo --tls
```
