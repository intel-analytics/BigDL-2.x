class ConvLSTM2D(ZooKerasLayer):
    """
    Convolutional LSTM.
    Note that currently only 'same' padding is supported.
    The convolution kernel for this layer is a square kernel with equal strides 'subsample'.
    The input of this layer should be 5D, i.e. (samples, time, channels, rows, cols) and
    dim_ordering='th' (Channel First) is expected.

    When you use this layer as the first layer of a model, you need to provide the argument
    input_shape (a shape tuple, does not include the batch dimension).

    # Arguments
    nb_filter: Number of convolution filters to use.
    nb_row: Number of rows in the convolution kernel.
    nb_col: Number of cols in the convolution kernel.
            Should be equal to nb_row as for a square kernel.
    activation: String representation of the activation function to use
                (such as 'relu' or 'sigmoid'). Default is 'tanh'.
    inner_activation: String representation of the activation function for inner cells.
                      Default is 'hard_sigmoid'.
    dim_ordering: Format of input data. Only 'th' (Channel First) is supported for now.
    border_mode: Only 'same' is supported for now.
    subsample: Tuple of length 2. Factor by which to subsample output.
               Also called strides elsewhere.
               Only support subsample[0] equal to subsample[1] for now. Default is (1, 1).
    W_regularizer: An instance of [[Regularizer]], (eg. L1 or L2 regularization),
                   applied to the input weights matrices. Default is None.
    U_regularizer: An instance of [[Regularizer]], applied the recurrent weights matrices.
                   Default is None.
    b_regularizer: An instance of [[Regularizer]], applied to the bias. Default is None.
    return_sequences: Whether to return the full sequence or only return the last output
                      in the output sequence. Default is False.
    go_backwards: Whether the input sequence will be processed backwards. Default is False.
    input_shape: A shape tuple, not including batch.
    name: String to set the name of the layer.
          If not specified, its name will by default to be a generated string.
