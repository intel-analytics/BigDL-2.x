For Python users, Analytics Zoo can be installed either [from pip](#install-from-pip) or [without pip](#install-without-pip).

**NOTE**: Only __Python 2.7__, __Python 3.5__ and __Python 3.6__ are supported for now.

---
## **Install from pip**
You can use the following command to install the latest release version of __analytics-zoo__ via pip easily:

```bash
pip install analytics-zoo     # for Python 2.7
pip3 install analytics-zoo    # for Python 3.5 and Python 3.6
```

* Note that you might need to add `sudo` if you don't have the permission for installation.

**Important:**

1. Installing analytics-zoo from pip will automatically install `pyspark`. To avoid possible conflicts, you are highly recommended to __unset `SPARK_HOME`__ if it exists in your environment.

2. Please always first call `init_nncontext()` at the very beginning of your code after pip install. This will create a SparkContext with optimized performance configuration and initialize the BigDL engine.
```python
from zoo.common.nncontext import *
sc = init_nncontext()
```

**Remarks:**

1. We've tested this package with pip 9.0.1. `pip install --upgrade pip` if necessary.
2. Pip install supports __Mac__ and __Linux__ platforms.
3. Pip install only supports __local__ mode. Cluster mode might be supported in the future. For those who want to use Analytics Zoo in cluster mode, please try to [install without pip](#install-without-pip).
4. You need to install Java __>= JDK8__ before running Analytics Zoo, which is required by `pyspark`.
5. `pyspark==2.3.2`, `bigdl==0.8.0` and their dependencies will automatically be installed if they haven't been detected in the current Python environment.

## **Install without pip**

If you choose to install Analytics Zoo without pip, you need to prepare Spark and install necessary Python dependencies.

**Steps:**

1. [Download Spark](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)

    - Note that __Python 3.6__ is only compatible with Spark 1.6.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.1 and >=2.2.0. See [this issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19019) for more discussion.


2. You are recommended to download Analytics Zoo prebuilt release and nightly build package from the [Release Page](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#release-download/) and extract it.
Alternatively, you can also build the Analytics Zoo from [source](../ScalaUserGuide/install/#build-with-script-recommended).

3. Install Python dependencies. Analytics Zoo only depends on `numpy` and `six` for now.

#### ***For Spark standalone cluster***

* __Remark__: If you're running in cluster mode, you need to install Python dependencies on both client and each worker node.
* Install numpy: 
```sudo apt-get install python-numpy``` (Ubuntu)
* Install six: 
```sudo apt-get install python-six``` (Ubuntu)

#### ***For Yarn cluster***

You can run Analytics Zoo Python programs on Yarn clusters without changes to the cluster (i.e., no need to pre-install any Python dependency).

You can first package all the required dependencies into a virtual environment on the local node (where you will run the spark-submit command),
and then directly use spark-submit to run the Analytics Zoo Python program on the Yarn cluster using that virtual environment.

Follow the steps below to create the virtual environment: 
   
* Make sure you already installed such libraries (python-setuptools, python-dev, gcc, make, zip, pip) for creating the virtual environment. If not, please install them first.
On Ubuntu, you can run these commands to install:
```
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python-setuptools python-dev
apt-get install -y gcc make
apt-get install -y zip
easy_install pip
```
* Create the virtualenv package for dependencies.
    * ```export ANALYTICS_ZOO_HOME=the folder where you extract the downloaded Analytics Zoo zip package```
    
    * Run ```${ANALYTICS_ZOO_HOME}/bin/python_package.sh``` to create the dependency virtual environment according to the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can add your own dependencies into this file if you wish. The current requirements only contain those needed for running Analytics Zoo Python examples and models.

    * After running this script, there will be `venv.zip` and `venv` directory generated in current directory. You can use them to submit your Python jobs. Please refer to [here](run.md#run-with-virtual-environment-on-yarn) for the commands to submit an Analytics Zoo Python job with the created virtual environment in Yarn cluster.

__FAQ__

In case you encounter the following errors when you create the environment package using the above command:

1. virtualenv ImportError: No module named urllib3
    - Using python in anaconda to create virtualenv may cause this problem. Try using python default in your system instead of installing virtualenv in anaconda.
2. AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'sslwrap'
    - Try upgrading `gevent` with `pip install --upgrade gevent`.
