# Colab User Guide

---

You can use Analytics Zoo without any installation by using  [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

### **1. Open a Colab Notebook**

Analytics Zoo includes a collection of [notebooks](./notebooks.md) that can be directly opened and run in Colab. You can click 'Run in Google Colab' that opens the notebook on Colab directly. Click the "run" triangle on the left of each cell to run the notebook cell. When you run the first cell, you may face a pop-up saying 'Warning: This notebook was not authored by Google'; you should click on 'Run Anyway' to get rid of the warning. 

### **2. Notebook Setup**

The first few cells of the notebook contains the code necessary to set up Analytics Zoo and other libraries.

**Install Java 8**

Run the following command on the Google Colab to install jdk 1.8

```bash
# Install jdk8
!apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk-headless -qq > /dev/null
# Set jdk environment path which enables you to run Pyspark in your Colab environment.
import os
os.environ["JAVA_HOME"] = "/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64"
!update-alternatives --set java /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java
```

**Install Conda**

Run the code bellow to install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) on Colab.

```bash
# Install Miniconda
!wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-4.5.4-Linux-x86_64.sh
!chmod +x Miniconda3-4.5.4-Linux-x86_64.sh
!./Miniconda3-4.5.4-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local

# Update Conda
!conda install --channel defaults conda python=3.6 --yes
!conda update --channel defaults --all --yes

# Append to the sys.path
import sys
_ = (sys.path
        .append("/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages"))

os.environ['PYTHONHOME']="/usr/local"
```

**Install Analytics Zoo**

Install the latest pre-release version using `pip install --pre analytics-zoo`. 
```bash
# Install latest pre-release version of Analytics Zoo 
# Installing Analytics Zoo from pip will automatically install pyspark, bigdl, and their dependencies.
!pip install --pre analytics-zoo
```

**Install Python Dependencies**

As Colab python environment provides some built-in Python libraries, you should check if the library versions are compatible with your application. You may refer [compatibility](./python.md) to specify the python library version that Analytics Zoo supports.
