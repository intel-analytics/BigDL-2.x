# Overview

In the image transfer learning example, we use a pre-trained Inception_V1 model as
image feature transformer and train another linear classifier to solve the dogs-vs-cats
classification problem.

In this example we are going to take a slightly different approach. We will still use a pre-trained
caffe Inception_V1 model, but this time we will operate on the pre-trained model to freeze first of
a few layers, replace the classifier on the top, then fine tune the whole model

# Preparation

1. Download the pre-trained model

You can download the pre-trained BigDL model [here](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/legacy/models).

In this example, we are going to use the Inception-V1 model. Please feel free to use other models.

2. Prepare the dataset

For this example we use kaggle [Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) train dataset.
After you download the file (train.zip), run the follow commands to extract the data.

This dataset contains 25000 labeled images. In our experimentation, however, only a few thousands images
could train a pretty good classifier. So you could use the `sample_training_data.py` script to sample a
smaller dataset, and this will greatly speed up your experimentation.


# Finetuning the model

If you use the script mentioned above to downsize the dataset, it is suffice to use spark-local
mode to run this example.
```
    spark-submit \
    --master local[physcial_core_number] \
    --driver-memory 10g --executor-memory 20g \
    --class com.intel.analytics.zoo.examples.nnframes.finetune.TransferLearning \
    ./dist/lib/analytics-zoo-bigdl_BIGDL_VERSION-spark_SPARK_VERSION-ZOO_VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
    --modelPath /tmp/bigdl_inception-v1_imagenet_0.4.0.model \
    --dataPath /tmp/train_sampled \
    --batchSize 32 \
    --nEpochs 2
```

After training, you should see something like this.

As you can see, we can get 98.3% accuracy only after the 2nd epoch.
