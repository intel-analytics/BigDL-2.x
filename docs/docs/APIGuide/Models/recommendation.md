Analytics Zoo provides three Recommenders, including Wide and Deep (WND) model, Neural network-based Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model and Session Recommender model. Easy-to-use Keras-Style defined models which provides compile and fit methods for training. Alternatively, they could be fed into NNFrames or BigDL Optimizer.

WND and NCF recommenders can handle either explict or implicit feedback, given corresponding features.

We also provide three user-friendly APIs to predict user item pairs, and recommend items (users) for users (items). See [here](#prediction-and-recommendation) for more details.

## Wide and Deep
Wide and Deep Learning Model, proposed by [Google, 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07792.pdf), is a DNN-Linear mixed model, which combines the strength of memorization and generalization. It's useful for generic large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse input features (e.g., categorical features with a large number of possible feature values). It has been used for Google App Store for their app recommendation.

After training the model, users can use the model to [do prediction and recommendation](#prediction-and-recommendation).

**Scala**
```scala
val wideAndDeep = WideAndDeep(modelType = "wide_n_deep", numClasses, columnInfo, hiddenLayers = Array(40, 20, 10))
```

* `modelType`: String. "wide", "deep", "wide_n_deep" are supported. Default is "wide_n_deep".
* `numClasses`: The number of classes. Positive integer.
* `columnInfo` An instance of [ColumnFeatureInfo](#columnfeatureinfo).
* `hiddenLayers`: Units of hidden layers for the deep model. Array of positive integers. Default is Array(40, 20, 10).

```

## Neural network-based Collaborative Filtering
NCF ([He, 2015](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiangnan/papers/ncf.pdf)) leverages a multi-layer perceptrons to learn the userâ€“item interaction function. At the mean time, NCF can express and generalize matrix factorization under its framework. `includeMF`(Boolean) is provided for users to build a `NeuralCF` model with or without matrix factorization. 

After training the model, users can use the model to [do prediction and recommendation](#prediction-and-recommendation).

**Scala**
```scala
val ncf = NeuralCF(userCount, itemCount, numClasses, userEmbed = 20, itemEmbed = 20, hiddenLayers = Array(40, 20, 10), includeMF = true, mfEmbed = 20)
```

## Session Recommender
Session Recommender ([Hidasi, 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06939.pdf)) uses an RNN-based approach for session-based recommendations. The model is enhanced in NetEase ([Wu, 2016](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7498326)) by adding multiple layers to model users' purchase history. In Analytics Zoo, `includeHistory`(Boolean) is provided for users to build a `SessionRecommender` model with or without history. 

After training the model, users can use the model to [do prediction and recommendation](#prediction-and-recommendation).

```scala
val sessionRecommender = SessionRecommender(itemCount, itemEmbed, sessionLength, includeHistory, mlpHiddenLayers, historyLength)
