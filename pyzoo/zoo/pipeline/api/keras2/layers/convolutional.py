class Conv1D(ZooKeras2Layer):
    """1D convolution layer (e.g. temporal convolution).

    This layer creates a convolution kernel that is convolved
    with the layer input over a single spatial (or temporal) dimension
    to produce a tensor of outputs.
    If `use_bias` is True, a bias vector is created and added to the outputs.
    Finally, if `activation` is not `None`,
    it is applied to the outputs as well.

    When using this layer as the first layer in a model,
    provide an `input_shape` argument
    (tuple of integers or `None`, e.g.
    `(10, 128)` for sequences of 10 vectors of 128-dimensional vectors,
    or `(None, 128)` for variable-length sequences of 128-dimensional vectors.

    # Arguments
        filters: Integer, the dimensionality of the output space
            (i.e. the number of output filters in the convolution).
        kernel_size: An integer or tuple/list of a single integer,
            specifying the length of the 1D convolution window.
        strides: An integer or tuple/list of a single integer,
            specifying the stride length of the convolution.
            Specifying any stride value != 1 is incompatible with specifying
            any `dilation_rate` value != 1.
        padding: One of `"valid"`, `"causal"` or `"same"` (case-insensitive).
            `"valid"` means "no padding".
            `"same"` results in padding the input such that
            the output has the same length as the original input.
            `"causal"` results in causal (dilated) convolutions, e.g. output[t]
            does not depend on input[t+1:]. Useful when modeling temporal data
            where the model should not violate the temporal order.
        activation: Activation function to use
            (see [activations](../activations.md)).
            If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied
            (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).
        use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
        kernel_initializer: Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix
        bias_initializer: Initializer for the bias vector
        kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
            the `kernel` weights matrix
        bias_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the bias vector

    # Input shape
        3D tensor with shape: `(batch_size, steps, input_dim)`

    # Output shape
        3D tensor with shape: `(batch_size, new_steps, filters)`
        `steps` value might have changed due to padding or strides.
