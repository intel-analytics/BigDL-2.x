# High dimension time series forecasting with Chronos TCMFForecaster 

This example demonstrates how to use Analytics Zoo Chronos TCMFForecaster to run distributed training 
and inference for high dimension time series forecasting task.


## Environment
You can follow the instructions [here](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#Chronos/tutorials/TCMFForecaster/#step-0-prepare-environment) to prepare environment for chronos TCMFForecaster.

## Prepare data
The example use the public real-world electricity datasets. You can download by running [download datasets script](https://github.com/rajatsen91/deepglo/blob/master/datasets/download-data.sh). Note that we only need electricity.npy.

If you only want to try with dummy data, you can use the "--use_dummy_data" option.

## Run on local after pip install
```
python run_electricity.py --cluster_mode local
```

## Run on yarn cluster for yarn-client mode after pip install
```
python run_electricity.py --cluster_mode yarn
```

## Options
* `--cluster_mode` The mode for the Spark cluster. local or yarn. Default to be `local`. You can refer to OrcaContext documents [here](https://analytics-zoo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/Orca/Overview/orca-context.html) for details.
* `--num_workers` The number of workers to be used in the cluster. You can change it depending on your own cluster setting. Default to be 2.
* `--cores` "The number of cpu cores you want to use on each node. Default to be 4.
* `--memory` The memory you want to use on each node. Default to be 10g
* `--data_dir` The directory of electricity data file.
* `--use_dummy_data` Whether to use dummy data. Default to be False.
* `--smoke` Whether to run smoke test. Smoke test run 1 iteration for each stage and run 2 iterations alternative training. Default to be False.
* `--predict_local` You should enable predict_local if want to run distributed training on yarn and run distributed inference on local."
* `--num_predict_cores` The number of cores you want to use for prediction on local. You should only parse this arg if you have set predict_local to true.
* `--num_predict_workers` The number of workers you want to use for prediction on local. You should only parse this arg if you have set predict_local to true.
