## **Examples**

Analytics Zoo provides plenty of examples ready for re-use as listed blow.

   * [Image Classification](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/zoo/src/main/scala/com/intel/analytics/zoo/examples/imageclassification): This example illustrates how to do the image classification with pre-trained model.
   * [Object Detection](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/zoo/src/main/scala/com/intel/analytics/zoo/examples/objectdetection): This example illustrates how to detect objects in image with pre-trained model.
   * [Recommendation](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/zoo/src/main/scala/com/intel/analytics/zoo/examples/recommendation): There are two Scala examples for recommender models, including wide and deep(WND) model and Neural network-based Collaborative Filtering(NCF) model.
                                                                                                                                                        The system ([Recommendation systems: Principles, methods and evaluation](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110866515000341)) normally prompts the user through the system interface to provide ratings for items in order to construct and improve his model. The accuracy of recommendation depends on the quantity of ratings provided by the user.
   * [Text Classification](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/zoo/src/main/scala/com/intel/analytics/zoo/examples/textclassification): This example uses pre-trained GloVe embeddings to convert words to vectors,
                                                                                                                                                                              and trains a CNN, LSTM or GRU `TextClassifier` model on 20 Newsgroup dataset
   * [DataFrame](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/tree/master/zoo/src/main/scala/com/intel/analytics/zoo/examples/nnframes)): There are three examples and they show how to perform transfer learning/model inference using pre-trained Inception v1 model with DataFrame-based API.
