# (Experimental) AutoML
_A distributed **Automated Machine Learning** libary based on **ray** and **tensorflow, keras**_


---

This library provides a framework and implementations for automatic feature engineering, model selection and hyper parameter optimization. It also provides a built-in automatically optimized model: _**TimeSequencePredictor**_ , which can be used for time series data analysis or anomaly detection. 


## 1 Automated Time Series Prediction 



### Training a model using _TimeSeuqencePredictor_

_TimeSequencePredictor_ can be used to train a model on historical time sequence data and predict future sequences. Note that: 
  * Current implementation only supports univariant prediction, which means target value should only be a scalar on each data point of the sequence. Input features can be multivariant.  
  * We require input time series data to be uniformly sampled in timeline. Missing data points will lead to errors or unreliable prediction result. 

   1. Before training, init RayOnSpark.   
  * Run ray on spark local mode, Example
```python
from zoo import init_spark_on_local
from zoo.ray.util.raycontext import RayContext
sc = init_spark_on_local(cores=4)
ray_ctx = RayContext(sc=sc)
ray_ctx.init()
```
  * run ray on yarn cluster, Example  
```python
from zoo import init_spark_on_yarn
from zoo.ray.util.raycontext import RayContext
slave_num = 2
sc = init_spark_on_yarn(
        hadoop_conf=args.hadoop_conf,
        conda_name="ray36",
        num_executor=slave_num,
        executor_cores=4,
        executor_memory="8g ",
        driver_memory="2g",
        driver_cores=4,
        extra_executor_memory_for_ray="10g")
ray_ctx = RayContext(sc=sc, object_store_memory="5g")
ray_ctx.init()
```

 2. Create a _TimeSequencePredictor_
   * ```dt_col``` and ```target_col``` are datetime cols and target column in the input dataframe 
   * ```future_seq_len``` is how many data points ahead to predict. 
```python
from zoo.automl.regression.time_sequence_predictor import TimeSequencePredictor

tsp = TimeSequencePredictor(dt_col="datetime", target_col="value", extra_features_col=None, future_seq_len=1)
```

 3. Train on historical time sequence. 
   * ```recipe``` contains parameters to control the search space, stop criteria and number of samples (e.g. for random search strategy, how many samples are taken from the search space). Some recipe with large number of samples may lead to a large trial pool and take very long time to finish. Current avaiable recipes are: _SmokeRecipe_, _RandomRecipe_, _GridRandomRecipe_ and _BayesRecipe_. _SmokeRecipe_ is a very simple Recipe for smoke test that runs one epoch and one iteration with only 1 random sample. Other recipes all have arguments ```num_random_samples``` and ```look_back```. ```num_random_samples``` is used to control the number of samples. Note that for GridRandomRecipe, the actual number of trials generated will be 2*```num_samples```, as it needs to do a grid search from 2 possble values for every random sample. ```look_back``` is the length of sequence you want to look back. The default values is 1. You can either put a tuple of (min_len, max_len) or a single int to control the look back sequence length search space. _BayesRecipe_ use bayesian-optimization package to perform sequential model-based hyperparameter optimization.
   * ```distributed```specifies whether to run it in a distributed fashion. 
   * ```fit``` returns a _Pipeline_ object (see next section for details). 
   * Now we don't support resume training - i.e. calling ```fit``` multiple times retrains on the input data from scratch. 
   * input train dataframe look like below: 
   
  |datetime|value|...|
  | --------|----- | ---|
  |2019-06-06|1.2|...|
  |2019-06-07|2.3|...|
  
```python
pipeline = tsp.fit(train_df, metric="mean_squared_error", recipe=RandomRecipe(num_samples=1), distributed=False)
```

4. After training finished, stop RayOnSpark 
```python
ray_ctx.stop()
```

### Saving and Loading a _TimeSequencePipeline_
 * Save the _Pipeline_ object to a file
 ```python
 pipeline.save("/tmp/saved_pipeline/my.ppl")
 ```
 * Load the _Pipeline_ object from a file
 ```python
 from zoo.automl.pipeline.time_sequence import load_ts_pipeline
 
 pipeline = load_ts_pipeline("/tmp/saved_pipeline/my.ppl")
 ```
 
### Prediction and Evaluation using _TimeSequencePipeline_ 
A _TimeSequencePipeline_ contains a chain of feature transformers and models, which does end-to-end time sequence prediction on input data. _TimeSequencePipeline_ can be saved and loaded for future deployment.      
 
 * Prediction using _Pipeline_ object

Output dataframe look likes below (assume predict n values forward). col `datetime` is the starting timestamp.  

  |datetime|value_0|value_1|...|value_{n-1}|
  | --------|----- | ------|---|---- |
  |2019-06-06|1.2|2.8|...|4.4|
 ```python
 result_df = pipeline.predict(test_df)
 ```
 
 * Evaluation using _Pipeline_ object
 ```python
  #evaluate with MSE and R2 metrics
 mse, rs = pipeline.evaluate(test_df, metric=["mean_squared_error", "r_square"])
 ```

 * Incremental training using _Pipeline_ object
 ```python
 #fit with new data and train for 5 epochs
 pipeline.fit(newtrain_df,epoch_num=5)
 ```

## 2 AutoML Framework Overview

There are four essential components in the AutoML framework, i.e. FeatureTransformer, Model, SearchEngine, and Pipeline. 

A FeatureTransformer (inherited from _BaseFeatureTransformer_ class) defines the feature engineering process, which usually includes a chain of operations like feature generation, feature transformations and selection. A Model (inherited from _BaseModel_ class) usually defines an optimizable model (e.g. AlexNet or LeNet), and a fitting function using an optimization algorithm (e.g. SGD, Adam, etc.). A Model may also include the procedure of model/algorithm selection. 

During training, a SearchEngine (inherited from _SearchEngine_ class) searches for the best set of hyper parameters for both FeatureTransformer and Model and control the actual model fitting process. A Pipeline (inherited from _Pipeline_ class) is a convenient utility that integrates FeatureTransformer and Model into an end2end data processing pipeline. A Pipeline can be easily saved to file and loaded for reuse later elsewhere. 

A typical training workflow with AutoML looks like below: 

1.	A FeatureTransformer and A Model are instantiated. A SearchEngine is then instantiated and configured with the FeatureTransformer and Model, along with search presets, specifying how parameters are searched, the reward metric, and etc. 
2.	The SearchEngine runs the search procedure. It will generate several trials at a time and distribute the trials in a cluster. Each trail runs feature engineering and the model fitting process with a different combination of hyper parameters and obtain the target metric. It may take a while if the search presets generate many trails or model fitting takes a long time.
3.	After all trials completed, the best configuration and fitted model are retrieved according to the target metric. They are used to generate the result FeatureTransformer and Model, which are in turn used to compose a Pipeline.  The Pipeline can then be saved to file and loaded later for inference and resume/incremental training.
