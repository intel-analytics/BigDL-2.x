# PPML (Privacy Preserving Machine Learning)

Analtyics-Zoo PPML is a end to end framework for building privacy presrving maching leanrnig applications, such as Trusted Cluster Serving and Federated Learning. Based on Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions) and LibOS projects, this framework empowers data scientist and big data developer to build PPML applications on large scale dataset without impacting existing applications.
