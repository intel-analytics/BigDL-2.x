# **Keras Examples**

We provide several simple examples here to show how to load a Keras model into BigDL and running the model in a distributed fashion.

Note that the Keras version we support and test is [__Keras 1.2.2__](https://faroit.github.io/keras-docs/1.2.2/) with TensorFlow backend.

For the sake of illustration, in these examples, we first define a model in Keras, then save it as a JSON/HDF5 file and load it into BigDL.

You can directly run these examples if you [install BigDL from pip](../../../../docs/docs/PythonUserGuide/install-from-pip.md). After the training, good accuracy can be achieved.

In the future, we are going to provide more examples for users to try out.
