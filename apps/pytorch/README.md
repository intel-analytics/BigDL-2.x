# Distributed Face Generation on Spark

This example is migrated from [PROGRESSIVE GROWING OF GANS](https://pytorch.org/hub/facebookresearch_pytorch-gan-zoo_pgan/), and demonstrates how to run distributed inference using a pre-trained Pytorch Model.

## Requirements & Prepare environments
See [Pytorch Requirements](https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo/blob/master/pyzoo/zoo/examples/pytorch/train/README.md#requirements).

## Run Jupyter
If you want to run spark local, just start jupyter notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```
