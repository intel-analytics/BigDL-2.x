/**
 * Shape the sequence of tokens to a fixed length.
 * If the original sequence is longer than the target length, it will be truncated from
 * the beginning or the end.
 * If the original sequence is shorter than the target length, it will be padded to the end.
 * Need to tokenize first.
 * Input key: TextFeature.tokens
 * Output key: TextFeature.tokens
 * The original token sequence will be replaced by the shaped sequence.
 *
 * @param len Positive integer. The target length.
 * @param truncMode Truncation mode. Either TruncMode.pre or TruncMode.post.
 *                  If TruncMode.pre, the sequence will be truncated from the beginning.
 *                  If TruncMode.post, the sequence will be truncated from the end.
 *                  Default is TruncMode.post.
 * @param padElement String. The element to be padded to the sequence if the original length
 *                   is smaller than the target length.
 *                   Default is "##". Make sure that the padding element is meaningless in
 *                   your corpus.
