# PPML (Privacy Preserving Machine Learning)

Analtyics-Zoo PPML is an end to end framework for building privacy presrving maching leanrnig applications on top of large scale dataset. 

## PPML for Big Data AI

Based on Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions) and LibOS projects, this framework empowers data scientists and big data developers to build PPML applications on top of large scale dataset without impacting existing applications.

Note: Intel SGX requires hardware support, please [check if your CPU has this feature](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000028173/processors/intel-core-processors.html).
