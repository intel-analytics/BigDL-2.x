# Summary

Python demo of transfer Learning based on Spark DataFrame (Dataset). 

Zoo provides the DataFrame-based API for image reading, preprocessing, model training and inference. The related
classes followed the typical estimator/transformer pattern of Spark ML and can be used in a standard Spark ML pipeline.

In this example, we will show you how to use a pre-trained inception-v1 model trained on
imagenet dataset to solve the dogs-vs-cats classification problem by transfer learning with Analytics Zoo.
For transfer learning, we will treat the inception-v1 model as a feature extractor and only
train a linear model on these features.

# Preparation

## Get the dogs-vs-cats datasets

Download the training dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats and extract it.
The following commands copy about 1100 images of cats and dogs into demo/cats and demo/dogs separately.

```
mkdir -p demo/dogs
mkdir -p demo/cats
cp train/cat.7* demo/cats
cp train/dog.7* demo/dogs
```

## Get the pre-trained Inception-V1 model

Download the pre-trained Inception-V1 model from [Zoo](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/bigdl-models/imageclassification/imagenet/bigdl_inception-v1_imagenet_0.4.0.model)

Alternatively, user may also download pre-trained caffe/Tensorflow/keras model. Please refer to
programming guide in [BigDL](https://bigdl-project.github.io/) 

# Training for dogs/cats classification

ImageTransferLearningExample.py takes 2 parameters:
1. Path to the pre-trained models. (E.g. path/to/model/bigdl_inception-v1_imagenet_0.4.0.model)
2. Path to the folder of the training images. (E.g. path/to/data/dogs-vs-cats/demo)

User may submit ImageInferenceExample.py via spark-submit.
E.g.
```
zoo/scripts/spark-submit-with-zoo.sh --master local[2] \
somePath/ImageTransferLearningExample.py \
path/to/model/bigdl_inception-v1_imagenet_0.4.0.model path/to/data/demo
```

or run the script in Jupyter notebook or Pyspark and manually set parameters

After training, you should see something like this in the console:

With master = local[2]. The transfer learning can finish in 8 minutes. As we can see,
the model from transfer learning can achieve over 90% accuracy on the validation set.
