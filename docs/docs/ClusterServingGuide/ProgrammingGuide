Analytics Zoo Cluster Serving is a multi-model supporting and highly scalable service for model inference based on Analytics Zoo. It implements Pub-sub schema via integrating Analytics Zoo with data pipeline platform (e.g. Redis), task scheduling platform (e.g. Spark), where you can push data to the queue and get result from the queue.

Currently the data pipeline platforms we support include: Redis
