Subject: So what is Maddi?
From: madhaus@netcom.com (Maddi Hausmann)

As I was created in the image of Gaea, therefore I must
be the pinnacle of creation, She which Creates, She which
Births, She which Continues.

Or, to cut all the religious crap, I'm a woman, thanks.
And it's sexism that started me on the road to atheism.
