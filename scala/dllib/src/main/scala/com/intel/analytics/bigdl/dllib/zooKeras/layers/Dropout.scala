/**
 * Applies Dropout to the input by randomly setting a fraction 'p' of input units to 0 at each

 * When you use this layer as the first layer of a model, you need to provide the argument
 * inputShape (a Single Shape, does not include the batch dimension).
 *
 * @param p Fraction of the input units to drop. Double between 0 and 1.
 * @tparam T Numeric type of parameter(e.g. weight, bias). Only support float/double now.
