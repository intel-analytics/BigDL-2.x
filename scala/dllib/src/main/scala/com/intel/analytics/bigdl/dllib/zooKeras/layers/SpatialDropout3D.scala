/**
 * Spatial 3D version of Dropout.
 * This version performs the same function as Dropout, however it drops
 * entire 3D feature maps instead of individual elements. If adjacent voxels
 * within feature maps are strongly correlated (as is normally the case in
 * early convolution layers) then regular dropout will not regularize the
 * activations and will otherwise just result in an effective learning rate
 * decrease. In this case, SpatialDropout3D will help promote independence
 * between feature maps and should be used instead.
 * The input of this layer should be 5D.
 *
 * When you use this layer as the first layer of a model, you need to provide the argument
 * inputShape (a Single Shape, does not include the batch dimension).
 *
 * @param p Fraction of the input units to drop. Double between 0 and 1.
 * @param dimOrdering Format of input data. Either 'CHANNEL_FIRST' (dimOrdering='th') or
 *                    'CHANNEL_LAST' (dimOrdering='tf'). Default is 'CHANNEL_FIRST'.
 * @tparam T Numeric type of parameter(e.g. weight, bias). Only support float/double now.
